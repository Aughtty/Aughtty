## About Me
I am a first-year Master's student at **Tianjin University**, majoring in **Computer Science and Technology**.  
My current research lies primarily in the field of **Computer Vision**, focusing on **image and video restoration**, **super-resolution**, and **low-level vision enhancement**.  
I am passionate about developing learning-based approaches to address visual degradation problems under complex real-world conditions.

## Research Interests
- **Computer Vision** – Image and video understanding, low-level visual perception  
- **Image Restoration and Enhancement** – De-noising, deblurring, dehazing, deraining, and illumination correction  
- **Video Super-Resolution** – Temporal consistency and real-world degradation modeling  
- **Deep Learning for Vision** – Combining physical priors with data-driven models to enhance generalization  
- **Generative and Multimodal Models** – Exploring diffusion models, vision-language alignment, and self-supervised learning

## Research Goals
My long-term goal is to design robust and efficient visual restoration frameworks that bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world data.  
I am particularly interested in integrating **deep generative models** with **physics-based priors**, to create interpretable and generalizable vision systems for challenging visual environments.
