## 🎓 About Me
I am a first-year Master's student at **Tianjin University**, majoring in **Computer Science and Technology**.  
My research primarily focuses on **Computer Vision**, with interests in **image and video restoration**, **super-resolution**, and **low-level vision enhancement**.  
I aim to design robust visual understanding and restoration models that perform reliably in complex, real-world scenarios.

## 📚 Research Interests
- **Computer Vision:** Image and video understanding, visual restoration, enhancement, 和 representation  
- **Image Restoration:** De-noising, deblurring, dehazing, deraining, 和 low-light image enhancement  
- **Video Super-Resolution:** Spatiotemporal consistency and degradation modeling  
- **Deep Learning for Vision:** Integration of physical priors with data-driven learning  
- **Generative and Multimodal Models:** Vision-language alignment, diffusion models, and self-supervised learning

## 🧩 Current Research
My current work centers on developing **deep learning-based image and video restoration frameworks** that generalize effectively to real-world degradations.  
I focus on bridging the gap between synthetic datasets and practical data through **degradation modeling**, **domain adaptation**, and **perceptual optimization**.
